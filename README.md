Develop a web UI for ‘The Star Wars API’ that will allow a user to choose his/her favorite movies.

The UI must consist of one screen divided into 2:

- Table of content (TOC) of all films - with the film’s title
- Film title, abstract, and an option to select favorite.

Use the following API for all movie-related data: https://swapi.dev/
Make sure the site remembers the user’s favorite selections if the user closes the page and
opens it again.

General guidelines:

- Reuse code where possible.
- Variables should have meaningful names.
- Functions should be small and have a single responsibility.
- The code should be formatted in a uniform manner according to the selected language
  best practices.
- Git commits should have short but meaningful and uniform messages.

Requirements:

- The UI should be responsive and look acceptable on small and large screens.
- Use GitHub.

Recommended:

- Write TypeScript and React.
